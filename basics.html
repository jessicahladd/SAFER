            <h3 id="subsection_1">What are sexual assault and consent?</h3>

            <p>Sexual assault is any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit and affirmative consent of the participants. Consent is the clear, informed, and voluntary agreement between all participants to engage in sexual activity. Consent is active, not passive and consent may be withdrawn at any time. Silence cannot be interpreted as consent. Consent can be given by words or actions, as long as those words or actions are mutually understood.</p>

            <h3 id="subsection_2">How common is assault on campus?</h3>

            <p>Prevalence of sexual assault is difficult to measure, due to chronic underreporting. Rape is the most underreported crime in the country. One study estimated that 20% of women are assaulted during their college career, while another study more broadly suggested the figure to be 9-30%. Women students are most likely to be assaulted in her freshman or sophomore year. Many men are sexually assaulted as well, although data on prevalence in men is limited. It has been suggested that 1 in 16 men (or 6%) are victims of attempted or completed sexual assault at college, but that number is most likely an underestimate. While not adequately studied, it is estimated that rates of assault are higher for marginalized populations, such as LGBTQ individuals, people of color, people with differing abilities, and people from other countries.</p>

            <h3 id="subsection_3">Who is assaulting people?</h3>

            <p>Repeat rapists commit nine out of ten college rapes. In most cases (75-80%), the survivor knew the perpetrator prior to the attack, whether as a classmate, friend, or sexual partner.</p>
						
						<h3 id="subsection_4">Do survivors tell people?</h3>

            <p>It is estimated that 2 out of 3 survivors confide to someone - most commonly a friend, rather than family or school or local authorities.</p>
						
						<h3 id="subsection_5">How common is reporting?</h3>

            <p>One study found that only 13% of college forcible rape survivors report their rape to local police, campus security, or other authorities, and only 2% of survivors who were assaulted while incapacitated report. Another study found that 20% of sexual assaults were reported to police.</p>
						
						<h3 id="subsection_6">Why don’t survivors just go to the police?</h3>

            <p>The reasons for survivors’ non-reporting (whether to a school or to law enforcement) vary.</p>
            
            <ul>
							<li>They blame themselves for the assault </li>
							<li>They don’t consider the assault to be serious enough to report </li>
							<li>They consider the incident was a personal matter</li>
							<li>They worry of not being believed</li>
							<li>They fear of reprisal by the perpetrator </li>
							<li>They fear retaliation from peers</li>
							<li>They fear insensitive? hostile? of treatment by authorities</li>
							<li>They belong to communities that are frequently the target of police violence and do not see the police as a supportive option</li>
							<li>They prefer community solutions to a punitive and/or carceral justice system</li>
							<li>They fear of punishment for activities preceding some assaults, such as underage drinking </li>
							<li>They are confused aboutover how to report</li>
							<li>They don’t want others to find out what happened </li>
							<li>They don’t want to get the assailant into trouble (especially if the assailant is an acquaintance)</li>
							<li>They don’t want to go through the trauma of reliving the assault</li>
							<li>They don’t want to participate in a formal college adjudication process, or believe there is lack of sufficient evidence</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3 id="subsection_7">Why do schools even handle sexual assault reports?</h3>

            <p>Title IX requires schools to ensure that students are free to pursue their education in an environment that is not hostile. Colleges serve an important role because they can provide survivors with support and accommodations that are not controlled by the criminal justice system. They can provide academic accommodations, residential changes, counseling, and they can issue no-contact orders. Colleges are able to suspend or expel assailants without waiting for the verdict of a lengthy criminal trial. Swift punishment of offenders can enable survivors to more comfortably resume their studies (without the fear of coming into contact with their assailant), and can protect other students from potential future victimization by the offender. Additionally, schools are directed to require a lower standard of proof (a preponderance of evidence) than that of criminal courts (beyond a reasonable doubt) in judicial proceedings. Moreover, the criminal justice system frequently fails to protect survivors or punish assailants. The process of a criminal investigation and trial can be traumatic for the survivor. Assaults rarely lead to arrests, and assailants are rarely prosecuted and even more rarely convicted. Additionally, some state laws do not recognize same-sex assaults, assaults perpetrated by women, or assaults of men. Finally, the university and criminal justice systems are not mutually exclusive, so filing a report to a university doesn’t prevent a survivor from also seeking justice through the criminal justice system.</p>
						
						<h3 id="subsection_8">What happens when someone reports?</h3>

            <p>Schools are required by Title IX to conduct an investigation whenever they know or reasonably should know about an incident of sexual assault. However, one recent study showed that over 40% of schools in the sample hadn’t initiated a single investigation during the previous five years.</p>
						
						<h3 id="subsection_9">How common are false accusations?</h3>

            <p>It is estimated that false accusations comprise somewhere in the range of 2-8% or 2-10% of reports. An accusation is considered false if law enforcement decides that the reported crime did not occur. Law enforcement makes this classification when they don’t believe the complainant or when the complainant recants. However, there are many reasons why a survivor may recant and why parts of a report may be inconsistent, exaggerated, fabricated, or lacking in important details.</p>
						
						<h3 id="subsection_10">Why might a survivor’s account have so many inconsistencies?</h3>

            <ul>
							<li>Foggy or fragmented memory of the assault, which can be caused by drug or alcohol use as well as by a psychological response to the trauma itself</li>
							<li>Uncomfortableness sharing details of the assault, especially those regarding the sexual acts that were committed</li>
							<li>Fear of not being believed, which may lead survivors to omit details that they fear would undermine their credibility (such as their own drinking, drug use, or illegal activity)</li>
							<li>Fear of being punished by incriminating oneself for illegal activity or insecure citizenship status</li>
							<li>Distrust of authorities</li>
							<li>Attempt to protect perpetrator, which is most relevant when the survivor and perpetrator have an ongoing relationship, or are both members of a certain group (eg an ethnic or religious group) and speaking out against a fellow member is seen as a betrayal</li>
							<li>Desire to create a case that seems more believable, such as falsely claiming that there was a weapon used</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3 id="subsection_11">What are the consequences of sexual assault for the survivor?</h3>

            <p>Sexual assault can have immediate as well as long-term effects on the survivor. An immediate concern is the physical health and safety of the survivor. Injuries, pregnancy, and sexually-transmitted infections are a risk. The longer-term effects can be equally serious. Often, survivors withdraw from social activities. Their academic performance frequently declines. They may not participate in class and submit lower quality work or they may miss class, assignments, and tests. These difficulties can lead a survivor to drop courses, transfer, or leave school altogether. Survivors have an increased risk of depression, personality disorders, and suicide. They are also more likely to develop eating disorders and issues with substance abuse and self-harm. Post-traumatic stress is common.</p>
            
            <p>The response a survivor receives after an assault can be as traumatic as the assault. Institutional betrayal is the term that refers to "wrongdoings perpetrated by an institution upon individuals dependent on that institution, including failure to prevent or respond supportively to wrongdoings by individuals (e.g. sexual assault) committed within the context of the institution." In one study, survivors who reported institutional betrayal experienced more severe post-traumatic stress and greater levels of anxiety, dissociation, and sexual problems.</p>
						
						<h3 id="subsection_12">What are the consequences of sexual assault for the perpetrator?</h3>

            <p>A recent review showed that, of students found responsible for sexual assault, 12-30% were expelled, 28-68% were suspended, 17% received educational sanctions, and 13% were placed on probation. Some were ordered to attend counseling or perform community service.</p>
						
						<h3 id="subsection_13">What are the consequences of sexual assault for the community?</h3>

            <p>The occurrence of sexual assault can have a deep impact on the college community. It threatens the actual and perceived safety of the campus and can make people question administrators’ commitment to protecting students. Schools that are negligent in prevention or response procedures face fines by the federal government. Cases that receive widespread attention can tarnish schools’ reputations and damage relations with students, parents, and alumni.</p>
						
						<h3 id="subsection_14">What can I do to support survivors I know?</h3>

            <ul>
							<li>Learn as much as you can about sexual assault and its effects. Not only will this knowledge enable you to better help the survivor, but your effort to understand will show the survivor that they are not alone. It is crucial that you understand the devastation of the trauma. </li>
							<li>Listen carefully and give your full attention to the survivor. Allow silences. It can be very difficult for a survivor to talk about their assault, and it’s important not to rush them.</li>
							<li>Believe the survivor. Avoid asking probing questions. If it seems like you’re interrogating them, the survivor might feel that you don’t believe them.</li>
							<li>Validate the survivor’s feelings, even if you do not understand them. Do not make any assumptions about what happened or what they are feeling.</li>
							<li>Take a moment to consider your words before you speak. You may feel the urge to reassure the survivor, but statements like “it could have been worse” or “you will be fine” may imply that you don’t appreciate the gravity of the experience and are minimizing its importance.</li>
							<li>Remind the survivor that the assault was not their fault. No one ever deserves to be assaulted.</li> 							<li>Remind the survivor that you support them, care about them, and don’t see them any differently.</li>
							<li>Respect the survivor’s boundaries. They may want time alone and they may not want to be touched.</li> 							<li>Don’t touch them unless you are certain that they are comfortable with that.</li>
							<li>Ask the survivor if they want any resources or support. If they do, offer help in seeking counseling or medical help, or reporting to campus or local authorities. Offer to assist the survivor in resuming their day-to-day life, such as accompanying them on errands or anything else that helps the survivor feel safe.</li>
							<li>Respect the survivor’s autonomy, and support them regardless of whether you agree with what they choose to do. An assault violates a survivor’s sense of safety and strips them of control, so it is crucial that you allow them to exercise their own agency. Do not offer unsolicited advice.</li>
							<li>Know that survivors respond in many different ways to an assault, and that there is no “correct” way to respond. Recovery is a lengthy and non-linear process. The survivor may seem fine one day and terribly anxious the next day. This is normal. They need time to process and grieve.</li>
							<li>Respect the survivor’s privacy and keep all information confidential unless you have the survivor’s permission.</li>
							<li>Don’t forget to take care of yourself. Supporting someone who survived a trauma can be very difficult. Pay attention to your own feelings and needs.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3 id="subsection_15">If I’ve been assaulted, what can I do?</h3>

            <p><b>Consider going to the emergency room</b></p>
						
						<p>You may consider going to the emergency room to make sure that you don’t have any physical injuries that require attention. You may want to get tested for STIs or obtain emergency contraception.
You do not have to go to report to the school or to police, but if at some point you choose to report and/or pursue disciplinary action, it will be helpful to have collected evidence. You can go to the hospital
forensic medical exam (commonly refered to as a rape kit) which collects physical evidence, and can be conducted up to seven days after the assault it is recommended that the survivor not shower, use the restroom, eat, brush teeth, or change clothes after the assault. The hospital will keep the evidence so bring a change of clothes for your friend if necessary.</p>
						<p>Most hospitals provide an advocate for sexual assault survivors to provide support during this process. You may request this person’s presence from the local rape crisis center if one is not sent automatically. In addition to emotional support, this advocate will provide information regarding the survivor’s legal rights and options. These advocates are also trained to support friends and family members so you may also feel free to discuss your concerns with this person.</p>

<p>Consider contacting a victim’s advocate, the health center, the Title IX Coordinator, etc if you want to report the assault - you can do this confidentially and usually anonymously</p>

						<p>Consider your options for reporting</p>
<p>you can officially report the assault to the school so they can begin an investigation
you can officially report the assault to campus or local authorities</p>
